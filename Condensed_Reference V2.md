# Prerequisites
Hanab is a game about working together to build up piles of cards in the correct order. You can't see your own cards and you are only allowed to give some cryptic information each turn. There are five colours (suits) and five numbers [1-5] in each suit, with the following distribution (1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5). The size of each player's hand depends on the number of players - in 2 - 4 player games the hand size is 5, in 5 player games the hand size is 4 and in 6 player games the hand size is 3.
On you turn you have three options:
1. Play a card. You won't necessarily know what this card is exactly (or at all), but if it fits on one of the piles then it is added to that pile. If it doesn't fit anywhere, it is added to the discard pile and a life is lost for the team.
2. Discard a card. The card is placed face up in the discard pile and a clue token is gained for the team. You cannot discard if the team already has eight clue tokens.
3. Give a clue. A clue takes the following form: "Player [X], these are all the cards in your hand that are [Colour]", or "Player Y, these are all the cards in your hand that are [Number]". E.g. "Alice, your first and second cards are yellow (and non of your other cards are yellow)" or "Bob, your fifth card is a 5 (and non of your other cards are 5s)".
The game ends when either all of a given card end up in the discard pile - e.g. both R4 are in the discard pile, as then the red pile can never be completed (this isn't always the case), when the third life is lost, or when the last card is drawn from the deck and every player has had one more turn.
The team wins if they complete every pile before the game ends.
When a player plays or discards a card, they draw a new card and add it to the front of their hand (generally the left).
If the team manages to play a 5, a clue token is added. If the team is already at eight clues then it's still legal to play the 5 but no clue token is added.

## The point of the convention / motivations
If you want to sit down and think about it (or if you just want to accept it), you will conclude that there aren't enough clues to tell everyone both the colour and the number of their cards before those cards get played. This means that we need a better strategy than just "tell everyone what their cards are" to have any chance of winning the game. The strategy doesn't have to be much better than this, perhaps just "if you get a clue on a card then that card is playable" has the potential to win the game, but it's hard to know what to make of the limited information you can give and receive unless you have discussed what each clue probably means with your team mates beforehand. We accept that the game can still be fun and rewarding even after having such a conversation, and we call the contents of that pre-game strategy our **convention**.

This is now the second version of this convention, the first version of which can be found here (). It's worth noting that this version will still borrow heavilly from Hyphen-ated's convention.
# The basics
We need some basic rules to help us play the game, and here are two key ways to interpret the majority of clues. I'll explain them in reverse order, so make sure to read both before using either.
## Play clue
Generally speaking, when you receive a clue it will highlight some cards that had never been highlighted ("touched") before. You are supposed to believe that **the frontmost newly touched card is playable** (perhaps after any other known playable cards). 
## Save clue
We agree that every player will try to discard in a predictable way, as this greatly simplifies the game. We agree that every player will always choose to discard their back (generally rightmost) card if they want to discard something. This means that the team knows which card is going to be discarded next and can act accordingly. We call this backmost card the **chop card**, as it is "on the chopping block" and will be killed on that player's next discard. It often happens that a player will end up with a *critical* card (a card with only one copy left in the game, a "danger card") on their chop. If this happens, it is very important for the team to tell them that they have such a card, *and* that they must not play it. To make sure that this is always possible, we define the Save clue:
If you receive a clue that touches your chop card, and this might be talking about a critical card (you can determine if this is the case by looking at the discard pile, among other things), then you must assume that this is a **save clue**. You are supposed to conclude that one of these highlighted cards is critical and must not be played or discarded. If only card is touched, then you can assume it is one of the possible critical cards. If more than one card is touched, then the team is telling you that at least one of these cards is critical, but they are saying nothing about the other cards. They could be critical, they could be useless, they could be useful in the future. You are supposed to hang on to all of these cards and just save them in your hand for later.
