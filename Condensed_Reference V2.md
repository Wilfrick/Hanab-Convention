# Prerequisites
Hanab is a game about working together to build up piles of cards in the correct order. You can't see your own cards and you are only allowed to give some cryptic information each turn. There are five colours (suits) and five numbers [1-5] in each suit, with the following distribution (1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5).
On you turn you have three options:
1. Play a card. You won't necessarily know what this card is exactly (or at all), but if it fits on one of the piles then it is added to that pile. If it doesn't fit anywhere, it is added to the discard pile and a life is lost for the team.
2. Discard a card. The card is placed face up in the discard pile and a clue token is gained for the team. You cannot discard if the team already has eight clue tokens.
3. Give a clue. A clue takes the following form: "Player [X], these are all the cards in your hand that are [Colour]", or "Player Y, these are all the cards in your hand that are [Number]". E.g. "Alice, your first and second cards are yellow (and non of your other cards are yellow)" or "Bob, your fifth card is a 5 (and non of your other cards are 5s)".
The game ends when either all of a given card end up in the discard pile - e.g. both R4 are in the discard pile, as then the red pile can never be completed (this isn't always the case), when the third life is lost, or when the last card is drawn from the deck and every player has had one more turn.
The team wins if they complete every pile before the game ends.
When a player plays or discards a card, they draw a new card and add it to the front of their hand (generally the left).
If the team manages to play a 5, a clue token is added. If the team is already at eight clues then it's still legal to play the 5 but no clue token is added.
