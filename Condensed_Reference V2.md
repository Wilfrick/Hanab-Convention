# Prerequisites
Hanab is a game about working together to build up piles of cards in the correct order. You can't see your own cards and you are only allowed to give some cryptic information each turn. There are five colours (suits) and five numbers [1-5] in each suit, with the following distribution (1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5). The size of each player's hand depends on the number of players - in 2 - 4 player games the hand size is 5, in 5 player games the hand size is 4 and in 6 player games the hand size is 3.
On you turn you have three options:
1. Play a card. You won't necessarily know what this card is exactly (or at all), but if it fits on one of the piles then it is added to that pile. If it doesn't fit anywhere, it is added to the discard pile and a life is lost for the team.
2. Discard a card. The card is placed face up in the discard pile and a clue token is gained for the team. You cannot discard if the team already has eight clue tokens.
3. Give a clue. A clue takes the following form: "Player [X], these are all the cards in your hand that are [Colour]", or "Player Y, these are all the cards in your hand that are [Number]". E.g. "Alice, your first and second cards are yellow (and non of your other cards are yellow)" or "Bob, your fifth card is a 5 (and non of your other cards are 5s)".

The game ends when either all of a given card end up in the discard pile - e.g. both R4 are in the discard pile, as then the red pile can never be completed (this isn't always the case), when the third life is lost, or when the last card is drawn from the deck and every player has had one more turn.
The team wins if they complete every pile before the game ends.
When a player plays or discards a card, they draw a new card and add it to the front of their hand (generally the left).
If the team manages to play a 5, a clue token is added. If the team is already at eight clues then it's still legal to play the 5 but no clue token is added.

## The point of the convention / motivations
If you want to sit down and think about it (or if you just want to accept it), you will conclude that there aren't enough clues to tell everyone both the colour and the number of their cards before those cards get played. This means that we need a better strategy than just "tell everyone what their cards are" to have any chance of winning the game. The strategy doesn't have to be much better than this, perhaps just "if you get a clue on a card then that card is playable" has the potential to win the game, but it's hard to know what to make of the limited information you can give and receive unless you have discussed what each clue probably means with your team mates beforehand. We accept that the game can still be fun and rewarding even after having such a conversation, and we call the contents of that pre-game strategy our **convention**.

This is now the second version of this convention, the first version of which can be found here (). It's worth noting that this version will still borrow heavilly from Hyphen-ated's convention.
# The basics
We need some basic rules to help us play the game, and here are two key ways to interpret the majority of clues. I'll explain them in reverse order, so make sure to read both before using either.
## Play clue
Generally speaking, when you receive a clue it will highlight some cards that had never been highlighted ("touched") before. You are supposed to believe that **the frontmost newly touched card is playable** (perhaps after any other known playable cards). 
## Save clue
We agree that every player will try to discard in a predictable way, as this greatly simplifies the game. We agree that every player will always choose to discard their back (generally rightmost) card if they want to discard something. This means that the team knows which card is going to be discarded next and can act accordingly. We call this backmost card the **chop card**, as it is "on the chopping block" and will be killed on that player's next discard. It often happens that a player will end up with a *critical* card (a card with only one copy left in the game, a "danger card") on their chop. If this happens, it is very important for the team to tell them that they have such a card, *and* that they must not play it. To make sure that this is always possible, we define the Save clue:
If you receive a clue that touches your chop card, and this might be talking about a critical card (you can determine if this is the case by looking at the discard pile, among other things), then you must assume that this is a **save clue**. You are supposed to conclude that one of these highlighted cards is critical and must not be played or discarded. If only card is touched, then you can assume it is one of the possible critical cards. If more than one card is touched, then the team is telling you that at least one of these cards is critical, but they are saying nothing about the other cards. They could be critical, they could be useless, they could be useful in the future. You are supposed to hang on to all of these cards and just save them in your hand for later. 
### 2 and 5 saves
We agree that the two most important cards in the game are the 5s (because there is only one copy of each 5), and 2s (because there are only two of them and they are required to get anywhere in the game). This means it would be nice if we had some extra ways to save these cards, as it is really important not to waste them. For this reason, we say that a number 2 or 5 clue on the chop is always a save clue (unless it can't be for some reason). You are also expected to save a 5 in this way, and usually save a 2 in this way (although sometimes with 2s it isn't possible).

# More advanced basics
## Principles
Now that you have a basic understanding of what some clues mean, it's worth pointing out some of the guiding principles that underlie this convention.
### Perfect players principle
This is the idea that everyone on your team is a perfect player that always does the right thing. This is generally not true, but believing it allows for a whole host of possibilities, so we choose to assume that this is the case. This will be the basis for justifying the meaning of "bad moves" - e.g. Alice probably should have played, but she didn't. Did she just make a mistke? Well no, because Alice is a perfect player, she must be trying to say something instead.
### Good touch principle
This is a useful priniciple from Hyphen-ated. It states that we only ever touch cards that are useful (that will get played at some point). Sometimes this will be broken if you have to give a save clue, but generally we work hard as a team to make sure that this is true, and then there is lots of potential for logical deduction because of this.
### Fix clues
This isn't so much a principle as a mindset, but here goes anyway. Sometimes (generally as the result of an unfortunate save clue) one of these principles may have to be violated. In that case it may be tempting to use a clue to try to "fix" the situation. Sometimes this can be done with surgical precision, giving clues that have obvious and unambiguous interpretations, but often giving more clues can be confusing. We therefore warn each other of using clues to "fix" things that aren't too bad. E.g. if someone will misplay a single card and then will be able to figure out what is wrong then don't bother wasting a clue on stopping them, just let it happen. In general, if you can "fix" a "mistake" with just one clue, perhaps consider it, but in general the mentality is to avoid making such mistakes in the first place. It's also worth noting that something that looks like a mistake to you might be the correct thing to do for the team e.g. (you are worried that someone will discard a critical card, but the team has forced them to clue something in your hand, so when it gets to their turn it's all good).

## The early game
We define the early game as before the first deliberate discard (the first discard for the sole purpose of generating a clue). During this time, we use a slightly different rule for 2 and 5 saves.
 - Any number 2 or 5 clue must be a save clue, regardless of position.
 
We also agree that we generally want to keep the early game going, so people *should* save 5s and 2s even if they aren't in danger of being discarded yet. It's worth noting that in general it's more important to save the cards nearer the back of someone's hand, but of course remember that if you can only save a 2 or a 5 then you must save the 5, as there is only one copy of this card.

You should also remember to play the game! You can still clue playable cards and get them played (mostly) and this is still a good thing to do.

## Fill in moves (Prompt/Finesse/Bluff)
Because play clues sometimes touch more than one card, often players will end up with a few cards in their hand that have a single clue on them that might not be (and in fact probably are not) playable. Because of good touch principle, that player knows that those touched cards  will be useful in the future, but they don't know what they are exactly. At some point, (usually after some more cards have been played) we would like to tell these players to play their cards, but it seems like a bit of a waste to use another full clue to fill in this card, given that they already know what "half" of it is and probably aren't far off deducing the card's true identity. It is for this reason that we define a **Prompt**, which is a specific instance of a *fill in* move.

A **Fill in** move is where a play clue is given to a card that clearly isn't yet playable. In this case, the group have two options - either assume that this was a mistake, or not. Now we assume that everyone is a perfect player that doesn't make mistakes, so how should the group interpret such an odd clue? The group interpretation is that this card *is* playable, it just needs some other prerequisite cards to be filled in first. Who should play these cards? Generally these cards come from the group's already clued cards (from the front, in which case this is called a **prompt**), but if there are no matching clued cards, then we define the *front most unclued card* in each player's hand as their **first finesse position*, and these are the cards that should be considered for fill in moves (and playing them would be called a **finesse**). It is worth noting that it is possible that multiple people could have the same card, e.g. one player has a R2 clued, and someone else has the other R2 in slot 1 (first finesse position). In cases like these, the last player that won't mess up is the player that will end up playing. It is also worth noting that you can't usually delay playing fill in cards, as not doing so will end up with another player misplaying a perfectly useable card.

It is possible to lie to someone and get them to play a card in the belief that they are being finessed, but this is generally worse for the team than playing a true finesse (because it is a lot slower). This is called a **bluff**, and sometimes is worth doing.


## Chop moves
Sometimes someone's chop card is important and you'd like to save it. You may also be in some situation where you can't give a good save clue, or where there is more than one card that you want to save at the same time. For situations like these (and for more options in general), we define the *chop move*. These are actions that result in telling a player that their chop card (or several chop cards) are all important and should be saved for the future. We have two types of chop move (for now), both of which have some non arbitrary motivation:

### 5 save chop move
**If you are clued a number 5 clue for a five that is one away from your chop card**, what are you supposed to think? Presumably that the 5 is playable, but that seemes unlikely given that the 5 wasn't clued earlier (it's still possible, but bare with it). Therefore, this is probably still a 5 save. Why save the 5 now? Well if the team waited one more turn then you would have discarded your chop card, so apparently they don't want you to do this. Therefore, **your chop card is important and not to be discarded (or even really played (yet))**. You also learn that you have a 5, which is pretty good as this would need to happen anyway at some point. Now sometimes this isn't ideal, because the 5 might actually be playable and the team doesn't want to chop move a useless card. In this case the team can probably just wait for you to discard the useless card, and then play continues as normal, so this isn't a big deal.

### Known trash chop move
**If you are given a clue that highlights only useless ("trash") cards, then you interpret that all the cards behind the backmost trash card are chop moved** (so are important, but not very playable). If there are no cards behind the backmost trash card (because this clue highlights the chop card), then this is a chop move on the first card that has not been clued, although this is an odd thing to do. ~~This may change~~


# A note about other conventions
Up to this point, most of what I've described is quite similar to the Hyphen-ated convention, so I thought now would be a good time to note the differences with that convention at this point. I'll also note what I've seen some other people play, although this is less relevant.
## Hyphen-ated (chop focus)
The key difference that the Hyphen-ated convention uses is that they insist on something called "Chop focus". This is where the card that a clue is talking about is a) the chop card, and then b) the frontmost card (if the chop card isn't touched). This can pretty much be swapped out for "play clues are talking about the frontmost card" as and when, so we are sticking with the "simpler" rule for now. I think that chop focus is slightly better than the rule we use, but I think it is mostly arbitrary, so for the time being I'll stick with frontmost playable.

## In person varient
Something I've seen in over-the-table play has been the following convention - every touched card is playable, unless you receive another clue on those cards, in which case you should stop playing them. There are no save clues nor chop moves, so it's hard to prevent critical cards from being discarded. I'm mentioning this here for some historical reference, but this isn't something I'd recommend if your aim is to win.
