Some definitons:

## Passing the Baton
A play baton is created when a Gentleman's discard happens, or when a player discards rather than playing when there are pleanty of clues to go round (at least 2 [I might change this]). The play baton is restricted to the current finesse position cards, "the track". Each player should pass the baton on the same number of times as how many playable cards they can see on the track. If the baton makes it back to a player who has passed it on enough times, then that player should play, which tells everyone if they had a finessable card on the track or not.
I'm not sure if this should then kill the baton, or if I should allow it to be passed to the next track (going backwards in each player's hand?)
