## Play Clue
If there is no other interpretation for a clue, the front most newly clued card is playable after giving other players the opportunity to play the interveening cards.

## Save Clue
If a clue touches a card on the chop and it could be talking about a card for which the other copy(s) have been discarded then you should just hang on to this card and any others clued along with it. You should certainly avoid discarding these cards. Number 5 clues on the chop are always save clues, unless the relevant 4s have been played. Also number 2 clues on the chop are save clues.

## Fix Clue
If someone is about to misplay a card because they have come to the wrong conclusion about it, you can stop them from doing so by giving a fix clue. This is not ideal, so try to find other ways of steering the game such that these clues don't need to happen.

## Conditional Chop Focus
If a save clue should be a direct play clue and the front card is not touched then this is a play clue on the chop card.

## Known Trash Chop Move
If some known trash is clued in your hand, it is because you should discard this rather than your chop, so you chop move all the cards behind the back most clued known trash card. If someone clues your chop card as know trash then something else is happening.

## 5s Chop Move
If a 5 is saved when it is one away from the chop, then it is being saved now because the chop card is important. You should chop move your chop card.

## Fill In Situation (Finesse, Prompt, Bluff)
If a not yet playable card is clued as playable then other players need to fill in the relevant cards from their hands, playing matching clued cards, followed by blind playing their front cards (finesse positon). If you can see someone else with the relevant card then you shouldn't play because they will.

## Sarcastic Discard
If you discard a known card, it is because someone has a the same card clued in their hand already. By discarding your copy you promise the other player that this card is at the front of the possible clued cards in their hand. If it isn't in the right place, you can probably wait a relevant number of turns and then discard, or you could just use your copy and deal with the resulting ambiguity.

## Passing the Baton
A play baton is initiated by refusing to play, among other things.
The play baton is restricted to the current finesse position cards (usually), "the track", including the finesse position of the initiator. Each player should pass the baton on the same number of times as how many playable cards they can see on the track. If the baton makes it back to a player who has passed it on enough times, then that player should play, which tells everyone if they had a finessable card on the track or not. Playing your track position card kills the baton.
