Welcome to the home page of this Hanab convention. This is inteded to be a reference document for the convention that I play when playing Hanab with others.


Here is an overview of what you can find here:
A full reference document of all the "moves" that we allow and what they all mean
A structured document explaining each "move" in relation to the other moves, with examples
A definitions document explaining the basic definitions that follow purely from the game rules.
