## Pros and Cons of the Play Baton
The play baton is in general, efficient but slow. If it is used to make one card playable, then this is usally fine, but for two or more cards it can get in the way while everyone waits to see what is happening.
It would be nice if we had another method of getting finessable cards played that we could use for lots of cards that was faster.
For the following definition, imagine that play batons don't exist.

# Fast track
If there are some playable cards in finesse positions, and the initiator has a choice between two good options, then they should do the action that corresponds to the number of playable cards mod 2. Each player can then see if they have a playable card or not in slot one.
This means that each player can know immediately if their cards are playable - they don't even need to play to show other players that they know this.
We can extend this further to say that if the initiator plays their x-th card, they are stating that they can see an odd number of finessible cards in finesse positons x. I should add that the initiator should choose to get the back most finessable cards played, as the cards near the front of people's hands are much easier to get played.
The initiator will never be talking about their own cards, so don't consider that possibility.

## Comparison of Fast Track and Play Baton
I hope that the fast track will be faster, but the play baton will be more efficient. This may well not be the case, but we'll see. (I assume it will be, because the play baton will usually consider more cards, but the fast track is over in one turn.) I assume that the play baton will only really be worth it for a small number of cards (e.g. 1) because of the extra card that the initator draws, and in other cases that the fast track should be better.
I also don't know how removing the option to avoid giving a fast track will be - eg "I'd rather let the next player give this fast track but I can't because that means I'm telling people to play cards that aren't playable." might not matter very much, or it could get in the way and inconvenience people.

# Bad tempo chop finesse
Usually, when you receive a tempo clue (a clue that makes you play an already clued playable card) you self chop move. However, if the other players can see that this would be a useless / unnecessary chop move, then they should assume that this player is playing this card now because it makes the next card playable. This would probably already have been prompted if possible, so we assume that the matching next card is in someone's chop position. The player with the matching card is expected to play their chop card blind.

## Multiple choice discards
When you have the choice between multiple cards to discard, we could use a similar construction to the Fast Track but for chop moves. I.e., if a player has the choice of two discardable cards, they would discard the back most one to indicate that they wish to give out an even number of chop moves on and their second from the back to indicate an odd number of chop moves. Each player can receive only 1 or 0 chop moves, so if you want to double chop move someone this could get sticky. If the discarding player has a choice of three discardables, then discarding card 3 (the third most discardable) signifies that they wish to chop move an odd number of "second chop" cards (cards that are one away from chop). You should always chop move chop cards first, but if there are an even number of chop cards that you want to chop move then discarding card 3 is an option.
This is just an outline and I need to think about it more to decide if it is good or not.
