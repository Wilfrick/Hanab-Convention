## Pros and Cons of the Play Baton
The play baton is in general, efficient but slow. If it is used to make one card playable, then this is usally fine, but for two or more cards it can get in the way while everyone waits to see what is happening.
It would be nice if we had another method of getting finessable cards played that we could use for lots of cards that was faster.
For the following definition, imagine that play batons don't exist.

# Fast track
If there are some playable cards in finesse positions, and the initiator has a choice between two good options, then they should do the action that corresponds to the number of playable cards mod 2 (possibly plus 1, I'm not sure yet). Each player can then see if they have a playable card or not in slot one.
This means that each player can know immediately if their cards are playable - they don't even need to play to show other players that they know this.
We can extend this further to say that if the initiator plays their x-th card, they are stating that they can see an odd number of finessible cards in finesse positons x. I should add that the initiator should choose to get the back most finessable cards played, as the cards near the front of people's hands are much easier to get played.
The initiator will never be talking about their own cards, so don't consider that possibility.

## Comparison of Fast Track and Play Baton
I hope that the fast track will be faster, but the play baton will be more efficient. This may well not be the case, but we'll see. (I assume it will be, because the play baton will usually consider more cards, but the fast track is over in one turn.) I assume that the play baton will only really be worth it for a small number of cards (e.g. 1) because of the extra card that the initator draws, and in other cases that the fast track should be better.
I also don't know how removing the option to avoid giving a fast track will be - eg "I'd rather let the next player give this fast track but I can't because that means I'm telling people to play cards that aren't playable." might not matter very much, or it could get in the way and inconvenience people.
