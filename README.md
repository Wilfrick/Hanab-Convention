Welcome to the home page of this Hanab convention. This is inteded to be a reference document for the convention that I play when playing Hanab with others.


Here is an overview of what you can find here:  
- A full [reference document](../blob/master/Full_Reference.md) of all the "moves" that we allow and what they all mean 
- A [structured document](../blob/master/Structured_Reference.md) explaining each "move" in relation to the other moves, with examples
