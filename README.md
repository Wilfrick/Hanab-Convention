Welcome to the home page of this Hanab convention. This is inteded to be a reference document for the convention that I play when playing Hanab with others.


Here is an overview of what you can find here:  
- A full [reference document](../master/Full_Reference.md) of all the "moves" that we allow and what they all mean 
- A [structured document](../master/Structured_Reference.md) explaining each "move" in relation to the other moves, with examples  
This is primarily intended to be a convention for three or four players, although I have high hopes that most of this should work for other incarnations of the game (especially five players).
