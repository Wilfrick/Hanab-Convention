You can do three things in Hanab(i):  
 * Play a card
 * Discard a card
 * Give a clue


The point of this (a?) convention is to assign extra meaning to each of these actions to convey more information and ultimately make the game easier.
To start with, I'll give some players' names, so that we can talk about *people* rather than just the cards. Hopefully this makes everything feel a bit more human, but who knows.
Our five players will be:
 * Alice
 * Bob
 * Charlie
 * Dave
 * Eve

Now for a question; what should you think when you receive a clue?

To answer this, I'll start by stating what you _should_ think, assuming that nothing \*special\* is going on and then later I'll define what I mean by something \*special\*. So, assuming nothing else, what should you think when you receive a clue? __It means that the newest newly clued card is playable after all of the other 'relevant' cards have been played__. For now, a 'relevant' card is a clued card in someone's hand that your card could rely on.

1. E.g. Nothing is played on the stacks, Alice has R1, R2, B4, P5, P2 and she is clued red, touching cards 1 and 2. No other cards have been clued. Alice now knows that her first and second cards are red, and that her first card should be playable after any relevant cards have been played. She looks around and sees that there are no other clued cards, so her first card is playable right now and is a Red 1.
2. E.g. The stacks are Y1,B2 and Bob has R3, P4, R2, Y3, R4, meanwhile Charlie has a R1 that has been clued as a 1. Bob is clued 2, touching the Red 2. Bob looks around for any relevant cards and sees that Charlie has a R1. He also looks at the stacks and sees the Y1. Bob concludes that his one is either Yellow or Red, and so he can play it after Charlie plays her R1.

A quick note: We make two rather bold assumptions, which are that as players we don't make mistakes and that we are all perfect logicians. This means that everyone always does the right thing, and if someone doesn't then it's for a good reason. I'm saying this now because it applies to what Charlie should do in example 2 above. Charlie can see the colour of Bob's Red Two and can see that it isn't playable, so she needs to fill in with her unknown one to ensure that Bob's two is playable, so she does. If however, she could see that Bob's two was yellow, then she doesn't need to play her unknown one and everything will be fine, so she can do something else that turn (like give a clue).
If this is confusing at the moment, that's fine, but do be warned that this is the kind of thinking that this convention is geared towards.

Okay, so we can get a player to play their left most unclued card by cluing it, but what should that player think about the other clued cards in their hand? Generally speaking, we give one promise to that player: __The other cards touched by the clue are playable in the future__. This is called the "Good touch principle" and is very helpful. It means that the clued cards in someone's hand will be useful at some point, so that person probably shouldn't discard them. It can also lead to someone playing a card that has been in their hand for a while because "the future is now".

1. E.g. The stacks are R1, Y3, G5, B3, P2 and Dave has a single clued card in his hand, which he knows is a 2. Dave knows that he has been promissed that his 2 will be playable in the future, which means it must be Red. Dave is allowed to play his 2 and a Red 2.

"Let's get a game started then. What should I be thinking when I'm playing?"
Generally you want to do the following:
* Play a playable card if you can, but if you can't then
* Give a good clue (what classifies as good will be defined in more detail later)
* Discard a card
But I hear you ask "but which card should I discard?". This is a good question. I think it's very helpful to know which card to discard, so I'll make some definitions and state some rules to follow.

We define a player's "chop card" as the card that is next in line to be discarded. Without any other thinking, this should be a player's right most card (the card closest to the discard pile). When a player needs to discard, they should discard their chop card, as this way everyone can predict what will happen.

There's just one more thing that I need to say before we start playing, which is about *Save Clues*.
We define a *Critical card* to be a card which only has one copy remaining in play.
1. E.g. a B5, or a R3 after the other R3 has been discarded.
If you receive a clue that touches your chop card, and it is possible that this clue could be talking about a critical card on your chop, then you are not to interpret this as a playable card, instead you must assume that a card is being saved and can assume almost nothing more. The only promise you are given is that your chop card will be playable in the future. You aren't even promissed that your chop card is the card that you think it is (usually - see example 2)
1. E.g. Eve has R3, R4, B1, Y2, R5 all unclued in her hand and the other R3 has been discarded. She receives a Reds clue, touching cards 1, 2 and 5. Eve looks at the discard pile and sees that the Red 3 is in there, so this could be a Red 3 save clue, and she can't play any of these cards.
2. E.g. Alice has
