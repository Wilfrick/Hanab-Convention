You can do three things in Hanab(i):  
 * Play a card
 * Discard a card
 * Give a clue


The point of this (a?) convention is to assign extra meaning to each of these actions to convey more information and ultimately make the game easier.
To start with, I'll give some players' names, so that we can talk about *people* rather than just the cards. Hopefully this makes everything feel a bit more human, but who knows.
Our five players will be:
 * Alice
 * Bob
 * Charlie
 * Dave
 * Eve

Now for a question; what should you think when you recieve a clue?

To answer this, I'll start by stating what you _should_ think, assuming that nothing \*special\* is going on and then later I'll define what I mean by something \*special\*. So, assuming nothing else, what should you think when you recieve a clue? __It means that the newest newly clued card is playable after all of the other 'relevant' cards have been played__. For now, a 'relevant' card is a clued card in someone's hand that your card could rely on.

1.E.g. Nothing is played on the stacks, Alice has R1, R2, B4, P5, P2 and she is clued red, touching cards 1 and 2. No other cards have been clued. Alice now knows that her first and second cards are red, and that her first card should be playable after any relevant cards have been played. She looks around and sees that there are no other clued cards, so her first card is playable right now and is a Red 1.
2.E.g. The stacks are Y1,B2 and Bob has R3, P4, R2, Y3, R4, meanwhile Charlie has a R1 that has been clued as a 1. Bob is clued 2, touching the Red 2. Bob looks around for any relevant cards and sees that Charlie has a R1. He also looks at the stacks and sees the Y1. Bob concludes that his one is either Yellow or Red, and so he can play it after Charlie plays her R1.
